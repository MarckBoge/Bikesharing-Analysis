# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike


## Overview

This Tableau Story can be seen at [this link](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeSharingChallenge_16639249528440/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The purpose for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for a presentation to stakeholders looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. As we all know Des Moines is far from the moving and shaking of the Big Apple, this analysis should allow us to answer a few questions about this investment.

  * How long are the bikes used for and who is riding?
  * How many trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week?
  * How many trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week?


## Results

The demographics of Des Moines may be different from the big city get up and go of New York City. A deep dive into CitiBikes riders should give  some good insight on who bikesharing will appeal to.

In the image above it is easy to see that more than 75% of all users are Subscribers, people who regular utilies the use of bikes. Our primary clientele base. Our bikeshare program users are also largerly male, about 65.27% male and 25.10% female.

The above map show the bike stations were record bike trips start. The size of the circle and the tint of blue indicates the relative number of trips started at those locations.From the image you can see that the majority of the bike trips are starting in the busy Manhattan area. Bike usage is lower in less dense areas.

This graph of numbers of trips by duration shows that a clear majority of trips on CitiBike bike do not last an hour. Most trips are under a half- hour.

Here is a breakdown of number of rides by duration, seperated by gender. This graph show very effectivly how many more rides male customers ride compared to female customers.

Here is a heat map of the number of bike trips by weelday for each hour of the day. From 6am to 9pm Monday thru Friday is the peak time.

This last heat map reinforces how much of our clientele base is dominated by our male identifyed subcribers.


## Summary

In conclusion, bikesharing services are great popular activity to have in a busy Metropolitan city, where local businesses and location are packed and parking is a problem. The larger male subscriber base provides reguler income. A campaign should be put together to rally female users.

If asked to gather additional information for analysis and visualization, with the data provided I would inquiry:

  * Trip starting and ending rush hour locations during the morning and evening, to display the flow of traffic betwween users commuting to work with local traffic.
  * User bike comfortability, by birth year, by gender to explorer if there a reason why there is more man then woman users.
